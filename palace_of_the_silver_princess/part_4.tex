\begin{quotebox}
    This watch tower room has 6 windows overlooking the surrounding
    lands. A trap door is in the center of the floor. A rope ladder lies
    to one side of it. Several arrows are embedded into the door, and a
    broken bow and a sword lay beside it.  There is a door in the east
    wall.
\end{quotebox}

After a round the players will hear scuffling and fighting noises from
the other side of the east wall door. Phrases like “Come on Briardoor, I
got her,” “no Joshua, not him” and “take that you filthy worm,” will be
heard intermixed with the other noises. If the players open the door to
investigate, bright light will fill the hallway, and all that will be
seen are three swords fighting each other as if by themselves. It is an
illusion placed there by the palace magic user to frighten intruders who
may decide to enter through the tower. The illusion will not be dis-
pelled by touch. The trap doors leads down to room \textbf{EL 38}.
