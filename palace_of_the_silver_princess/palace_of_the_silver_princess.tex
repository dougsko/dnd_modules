	Years ago the valley was green, and animals ran free through golden
	fields of grain. The princess Argenta ruled over this peaceful land
	and the people were secure and happy. Then one day a warrior riding
	a red dragon appeared in the skies over the princess’ castle and
	almost overnight the tiny kingdom fell into ruin. Now only ruins and
	rumors remain, and what legends there are tell of a fabulous ruby
	still buried somewhere within the Palace of the Silver Princess.
