            Years ago the valley was green, and animals ran free through golden
            fields of grain. The princess Argenta ruled over this peaceful land
            and the people were secure and happy. Then one day a warrior riding
            a red dragon appeared in the skies over the princess’ castle and
            almost overnight the tiny kingdom fell into ruin. Now only ruins and
            rumors remain, and what legends there are tell of a fabulous ruby
            still buried somewhere within the Palace of the Silver Princess.
